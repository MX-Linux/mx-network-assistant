If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</i></p>

Portions of the code came originally from the muser application of SimplyMEPIS, which was similarly covered by the Apache 2.0 license. Those portions concern utility functions and some logic regarding gui interaction; they have been thoroughly reworked here with permission from the developer Warren Woodford.</i></p>
